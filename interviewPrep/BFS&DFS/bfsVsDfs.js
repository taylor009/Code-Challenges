//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS

//If the tree is very wide: DFS

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS

//Finding the shortest path: BFS
